# Dungeon Clicker - ETNA Project

This is a small project of ETNA made during the year of integrated preparation. It aimed to learn the basics of JavaScript. During the redesign of my GitHub, I have rearranged it without changing the basic operation.

## Description

Dungeon Clicker is a clicker game where the player earns gold by clicking and can buy minions to automate gold production.

Note that the admin page is only accessible via the direct link (the URL to the page) or by double-clicking on the `.html` file itself.

## Features

- Click to earn gold
- Buy minions to automate gold production
